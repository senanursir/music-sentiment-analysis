# Spotify Music Emotion Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the lyrics and audio features of popular English songs (2020–2024) to uncover their emotional profiles. Data is collected from Spotify and Genius APIs, followed by emotion analysis and correlation studies.  

The project is currently in its early stages. Lyrics have been successfully collected, and the next steps will involve data cleaning, emotion analysis, and visualization.  

## Objectives
- Perform emotion analysis on popular songs  
- Explore the relationship between Spotify audio features (danceability, energy, valence, etc.) and emotions  
- Identify emotional profiles of different music genres  
- Observe emotional trends in popular songs over time (2020–2024)  

## Data Sources
- **Datasets:**
  - Spotify Audio Features  
  - Genius Lyrics  
  - Billboard Hot 100 (2020–2024)  

- **Planned Libraries:**
  - spotipy (Spotify API)  
  - lyricsgenius (Genius API)  
  - pandas, numpy  
  - scikit-learn  
  - matplotlib, seaborn, plotly  
  - nltk, textblob, transformers  
  - requests, beautifulsoup4  

## Project Plan
The project follows a four-week plan:  

1. **Data Collection & Exploration**  
   - Collect lyrics and audio features via Spotify and Genius APIs  
   - Gather Billboard Hot 100 data  
   - Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  

2. **Data Analysis & Preprocessing**  
   - NLP tasks (cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization)  
   - Apply emotion analysis methods (VADER, TextBlob, transformer models)  
   - Correlation and distribution analysis of audio features  

3. **Analysis & Modeling**  
   - Correlation analysis (Pearson, Spearman)  
   - Clustering (K-means, hierarchical clustering)  
   - Trend analysis (yearly emotion and feature trends)  

4. **Reporting & Results**  
   - Visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)  
   - Reporting results in Jupyter Notebook  
   - Sharing via GitHub repository  

## Expected Outcomes
- Emotion–Music correlation map  
- Emotional profiles of music genres  
- Emotional trends of popular songs (2020–2024)  
- Insights on how audio features affect emotions
