What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mеnds or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place

For thе record (Shit)
Throwin' in the towel takes some effort
So I’d rather ride it out for better weather
Together

Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
That's when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place

We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we been together
Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we're better
Off with all this, but we're caught in-between

A rock and a hard place
Tears rollin' down your face
As I walked out that door
That's when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
How much more of this can we take?",True

And let me show you what's past that pavement
Right there's where I crashed my first truck
And this field is old man Waylons
Catch a good vibe
Feeling alright
Solo cups circled up in the summertime
Got some good friends, take it all in
It's gonna be the time of your life

We're all out here tearing it up on a Saturday night

We're just small town crazy

Write it down, scratch it off your wishlist
Cash it in like a 1 way ticket
What you need, can't you see
Everything that you been missing

When you roll by every night at nine
And you're telling me you wanna fix what's broken, oh
Yet you're gone before the mornin' light

You sure know how to shake this house
And leave a man restless
""I love you"" shouldn't leave your mouth
'Cause that's when things get reckless

'Cause when you're on my mind
I drink a little more, yeah, smoke a little more, yeah
It's always one last time
My engine's on fire, burnin' these tires
Yeah, I'm already headed off of these two rails
Flyin' straight back to where we fell
I wanted the fast track, but now I want you back
Since you left, I'm just a train wreck

And all these problems, shoulda hit 'em head on, girl, oh
Instead, we let all our crazy drive
And all these memories are hittin' home harder, oh
Can't keep my eyes between the yellow lines

'Cause when you're on my mind
I drink a little more, yeah, smoke a little more, yeah
It's always one last time
My engine's on fire, burnin' these tires
Yeah, I'm already headed off of these two rails
Flyin' straight back to where we fell
I wanted the fast track, but now I want you back

""I love you"" keeps runnin' its mouth
Keepin' us reckless

'Cause when you're on my mind
I drink a little more, yeah, smoke a little more, yeah
It's always one last time
My engine's on fire, burnin' these tires
Up and down them county lines
Dodgin' every caution light
On my way back to you
Shoulda hit the brakes, shoulda used my mind
It's too late, I'm pullin' in your drive
Ain't no gettin' 'round it tonight, we're a train wreck",True

I been down a few broken roads that I'm tryin' to mend
But this is where it ends
And I'm breakin' down
You were lyin' when you said that you were tryin' to work things out
But now I'm broken down

Went to battle for you always
Fought for you on your worst days
Then you told me that you don't love me no more

You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance
And like a jet plane on a clear blue sky
Sun came shinin' down on all your lies
I got too much pridе to let that happen again
So this is wherе it ends

Had to bury all your memories
Couldn't see what everybody sees
Red flags said I shoulda walked out that door

Fought for you on your worst days

Yeah, this is where it ends

You're the best thing that ever happened to me
You showed me what true love shouldn't be
I found myself the second I gave up on us

You're the last thing that I thought I'd lose
All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
I let you back in and I gave you a second chance (Second chance)
