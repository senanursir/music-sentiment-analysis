No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin', if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right, Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out, like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway, then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood, grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this, swerve, surfin' all in this good-good (Ha-ha-ha)

Talkin' 'bout you be reppin' that Third, I wanna see all the shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side, ain't got the time to take drawers off

Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted, then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted

'Cause they'd stick up for me

I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl

You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask ""Whose is it?""
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah
